# Multi User Blog

2nd submission in Udacity's Full Stack Developer Nanodegree

This multi user blog was created using:

- Python: 2.7
- Template Engine: Jinja2
- App Engine: Webapp2
- DB: Google Datastore
- Theme: [StartBootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/)

I implemented the theme in a GCE Python app and used Jinja to inject assets.

Blog picture background was taken from [Unspash](https://unsplash.com) - Free stock Photos

To run locally, simply download this repository and run the webserver `dev_appserver.py [app_directory]`
